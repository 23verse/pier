\textbf{Motivation}
\end{quote}

The field of target discovery has been advanced by genetics-led target prioritisation approaches. Integrative prioritisation for early-stage genetic target discovery has proven cost-effective in promoting the translational use of disease genetic associations, which is increasingly recognised in reducing drug attrition rate in late-stage clinical trials.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Design}
\end{quote}

Building on the verified Pi approach (see \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253980}{Nature Genetics 2019}), here I introduce web-based servers/facilities called \texttt{PiER}. The PiER is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement, allowing the users to perform ab initio and real-time target prioritisation harnessing human disease genetics, functional genomics and protein interactions.

By analogy to the \href{https://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/grand-staff.html}{piano stave}, the PiER consists of five horizontal lines, with three lines representing the elementary facility (\texttt{eV2CG}, \texttt{eCG2PG} and \texttt{eCrosstalk}), each doing specific tasks on their own, and the rest two lines signifying the combinatory facility (\texttt{cTGene} and \texttt{cTCrosstalk}).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{ev2cg}{eV2CG}, linking variants to core genes; see \href{/app/examples/_tmp_RMD_eV2CG.html}{Example Output}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{ecg2pg}{eCG2PG}, networking core genes to peripheral genes; see \href{/app/examples/_tmp_RMD_eCG2PG.html}{Example Output}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{ecrosstalk}{eCrosstalk}, identifying the crosstalk between pathways; see \href{/app/examples/_tmp_RMD_eCrosstalk.html}{Example Output}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{ctgene}{cTGene}, prioritising targets at the gene level; see \href{/app/examples/_tmp_RMD_cTGene.html}{Example Output}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{ctcrosstalk}{cTCrosstalk}, prioritising targets at the crosstalk level; see \href{/app/examples/_tmp_RMD_cTCrosstalk.html}{Example Output}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{facilities}{%
\chapter{Facilities}\label{facilities}}

The elementary facility supports three specific tasks, including three online tools: (i) \texttt{eV2CG}, utilising functional genomics to link disease-associated variants (including those located at the non-coding genome) to core genes likely responsible for genetic associations; (ii) \texttt{eCG2PG}, using knowledge of protein interactions to `network' core genes with each other and with additional peripheral genes as well, producing a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and (iii) \texttt{eCrosstalk}, exploiting the information of pathway-derived interactions to identify highly ranked genes that mediate the crosstalk between molecular pathways. By chaining together elementary tasks supported in the elementary facility, the combinatory facility enables the automation of genetics-led and network-based integrative prioritisation for genetic targets, both at the gene level (\texttt{cTGene}) and at the crosstalk level (\texttt{cTCrosstalk}). Notably, in addition to target crosstalk, the \texttt{cTCrosstalk} further supports target pathway prioritisation and crosstalk-based drug repurposing analysis (that is, repositioning approved drugs from original disease indications into new ones).

\caption{The landing frontpage (visited using Google Chrome in MacBook Pro) of the PiER, featuring two facilities (`elementary` and `combinatory`). The elementary facility includes: (i) `eV2CG`, linking disease associated variants (particularly located at the non-coding genomic region) to core genes likely responsible for genetic associations, based on either promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C, that is, conformation evidence), quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (that is, genetic regulation of gene expression or protein abundance), or simply genomic proximity; (ii) `eCG2PG`, using knowledge of protein interactions to ‘network’ core genes with each other and with additional peripheral genes as well, producing a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and (iii) `eCrosstalk`, exploiting the information of pathway-derived interactions to identify highly-ranked genes that mediate the crosstalk between molecular pathways. By chaining together elementary tasks supported in the elementary facility, the combinatory facility enables automation of genetics-led and network-based integrative prioritisation for genetic targets: (iv) at the gene level (`cTGene`); and (v) at the crosstalk level (`cTCrosstalk`). Also included is the tutorial-like booklet (in an HTML format) describing step-by-step instructions on how to use.}\label{fig:app-front}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{development}{%
\chapter{Development}\label{development}}

The PiER was developed using a next-generation Perl web framework \href{https://www.mojolicious.org}{Mojolicious} that requires nearly zero-effort maintenance for interface updates. The PiER was also built using \href{https://getbootstrap.com}{Bootstrap} that supports the mobile-first and responsive webserver. The source codes are made available at \href{https://github.com/23verse/pier}{GitHub}.

Each user-request interface has the \texttt{Show/Hide\ Info} toggle button that contains the help information on use, including the details on input, output, mechanism and other useful information, while the \texttt{Example\ I/O} button showcases the example input/output. For example, shown below is the screenshot in the \texttt{cTCrosstalk} interface.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{Output:\ target\ genes}: includes \texttt{Manhattan\ plot} illustrating priority rating for target genes that are color-coded by chromosomes. Also provided is the downloadable PDF file. It also includes \texttt{Prioritisation\ table} listing all prioritised genes, each receiving 5-star priority rating (scored 0-5), and \texttt{Evidence\ table} for core genes showing which SNPs are used to define core genes based on which evidence. Genes are cross-referenced and hyperlinked to GeneCards.
\item
  \texttt{Output:\ target\ pathways}: includes a dot plot and a prioritisation table for target pathways. Also provided is the downloadable PDF file.
\item
  \texttt{Output:\ targets\ at\ the\ crosstalk\ level}: includes \texttt{A\ network\ visualisation} illustrating the crosstalk between pathways, with genes colored by priority rating and labelled in the form of \texttt{rating®rank}, \texttt{Prioritisation\ table}
  listing crosstalk genes, each receiving 5-star priority rating (scored 0-5), and \texttt{Evidence\ table} for pathway crosstalk genes, showing which SNPs are used to crosstalk genes based on which evidence. Genes are cross-referenced and hyperlinked to GeneCards.
\item
  \texttt{Output:\ crosstalk-based\ drug\ repurposing}: includes \texttt{A\ heatmap-like\ illustration} showing drug repurposing analysis of approved drugs (licensed medications) based on pathway crosstalk genes, with crosstalk genes on y-axis, disease indications on x-axis, red dots indexed in number and referenced beneath in the table where the information on approved drugs and mechanisms of action is detailed. It also includes \texttt{An\ interactive\ table} of crosstalk genes (the column \texttt{Crosstalk\ genes}), disease indications (the column \texttt{Disease\ indications}), approved drugs and mechanisms (the column \texttt{Approved\ drugs\ {[}mechanisms\ of\ action{]}}), and drug index (the column \texttt{Index}) shown above within the dot plot.

\caption{Prioritisation results for the `cTCrosstalk`. In addition to a summary of input data and the runtime (computed on the server side) under the tab `Input into cTCrosstalk`, the prioritisation results page provides the output, including target genes under the tab `Output: target genes` (the same as shown in the `cTGene`), target pathways under the tab `Output: target pathways`, and targets at the crosstalk level under the tab `Output: targets at the crosstalk level`, and crosstalk-based drug repurposing under the tab `Output: crosstalk-based drug repurposing`. Under the tab `Output: target genes` include  network visualisation of the crosstalk, with genes/nodes colour-coded by priority rating and labelled in the form of `rating®rank`, and two tabular displays about prioritisation and evidence for crosstalk genes.}\label{fig:cTCrosstalk-results}
