Motivation We and others are leading the field of target discovery through developing approaches for genetics-led target prioritisation. Integrative prioritisation for early-stage genetic target discovery has been demonstrated to be cost-effective in promoting the translational use of disease genetic associations, a principle increasingly recognised to reduce drug attrition rate in late-stage clinical trials. Design Building on our well-established algorithm (see Nature Genetics 2019), here I introduce web-based servers/facilities called PiER. The PiER is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement, allowing the users to perform real-time target prioritisation harnessing human disease genetics, functional genomics, and protein interactions. By analogy to the piano stave, the PiER consists of five horizontal lines, with three lines representing the elementary facility (eV2CG, eCG2PG and eCrosstalk), each doing specific tasks on their own, and the rest two lines signifying the combinatory facility (cTGene and cTCrosstalk), making the prioritisaton process transparent to follow and easy to use. eV2CG, linking variants to core genes; see Sample Output eCG2PG, networking core genes to peripheral genes; see Sample Output eCrosstalk, identifying the crosstalk between pathways; see Sample Output cTGene, prioritising targets at the gene level; see Sample Output cTCrosstalk, prioritising targets at the crosstalk level; see Sample Output Section 2 Facilities The elementary facility supports three specific tasks, including: (i) eV2CG, utilising functional genomics to link disease-associated variants (including those located at the non-coding genome) to core genes likely responsible for genetic associations; (ii) eCG2PG, using knowledge of protein interactions to ‘network’ core genes to each other and also to additional peripheral genes, producing a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and (iii) eCrosstalk, exploiting the information of pathway-derived interactions to identify highly ranked genes that mediate the crosstalk between molecular pathways. Through chaining together elementary tasks supported in the elementary facility, the combinatory facility enables the automation of genetics-led and network-based integrative prioritisation for genetic targets at the gene level (cTGene) and also at the crosstalk level (cTCrosstalk). Notably, in addition to target crosstalk, the cTCrosstalk further supports target pathway prioritisation and crosstalk-based drug repurposing analysis (that is, repositioning approved drugs into new disease indications).

The elementary facility includes: (i) eV2CG, linking disease associated variants (particularly located at the non-coding genomic region) to (core) genes likely responsible for associations, based on either conformation evidence (that is, promoter-centered chromatin interactions), quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (that is, genetic regulation of gene expression or protein abundance), or simply genomic proximity; (ii) eCG2PG, using the knowledge of protein interactions to ‘network’ core genes to each other and to additional (peripheral) genes as well, generating a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and (iii) eCrosstalk, exploiting the information of well-curated pathway-derived interactions to identify the subnetwork of highly ranked genes that mediate pathway crosstalk. Chaining together elementary functionalities above into pipelines provides the combinatory facility, enabling/automating genetics-led and network-based identification and prioritisation of drug targets: (iv) at the gene level (cTGene); and (v) at the crosstalk level (cTCrosstalk). Also included is the tutorial-like booklet (in a HTML- and PDF-format) of explaining step-by-step instructions.
