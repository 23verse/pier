The above-water pillar structure in red (symbolising the infrastructure) and water waves in blue (by analogy the piano stave) collectively illustrate the web-based PiER facilities enabling ab initio and real-time genetic target prioritisation. Motivation The field of target discovery has been advanced by genetics-led target prioritisation approaches. Integrative prioritisation for early-stage genetic target discovery has proven cost-effective in promoting the translational use of disease genetic associations, which is increasingly recognised in reducing drug attrition rate in late-stage clinical trials. Design Building on the verified Pi approach (see Nature Genetics 2019), here I introduce web-based servers/facilities called PiER. The PiER is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement, allowing the users to perform ab initio and real-time target prioritisation harnessing human disease genetics, functional genomics and protein interactions. By analogy to the piano stave, the PiER consists of five horizontal lines, with three lines representing the elementary facility (eV2CG, eCG2PG and eCrosstalk), each doing specific tasks on their own, and the rest two lines signifying the combinatory facility (cTGene and cTCrosstalk). eV2CG, linking variants to core genes; see Example Output eCG2PG, networking core genes to peripheral genes; see Example Output eCrosstalk, identifying the crosstalk between pathways; see Example Output cTGene, prioritising targets at the gene level; see Example Output cTCrosstalk, prioritising targets at the crosstalk level; see Example Output Section 2 Facilities The elementary facility supports three specific tasks, including three online tools: (i) eV2CG, utilising functional genomics to link disease-associated variants (including those located at the non-coding genome) to core genes likely responsible for genetic associations; (ii) eCG2PG, using knowledge of protein interactions to ‘network’ core genes with each other and with additional peripheral genes as well, producing a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and (iii) eCrosstalk, exploiting the information of pathway-derived interactions to identify highly ranked genes that mediate the crosstalk between molecular pathways. By chaining together elementary tasks supported in the elementary facility, the combinatory facility enables the automation of genetics-led and network-based integrative prioritisation for genetic targets, both at the gene level (cTGene) and at the crosstalk level (cTCrosstalk). Notably, in addition to target crosstalk, the cTCrosstalk further supports target pathway prioritisation and crosstalk-based drug repurposing analysis (that is, repositioning approved drugs from original disease indications into new ones).

The elementary facility includes: (i) eV2CG, linking disease associated variants (particularly located at the non-coding genomic region) to core genes likely responsible for genetic associations, based on either promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C, that is, conformation evidence), quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (that is, genetic regulation of gene expression or protein abundance), or simply genomic proximity; (ii) eCG2PG, using knowledge of protein interactions to ‘network’ core genes with each other and with additional peripheral genes as well, producing a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and (iii) eCrosstalk, exploiting the information of pathway-derived interactions to identify highly-ranked genes that mediate the crosstalk between molecular pathways. By chaining together elementary tasks supported in the elementary facility, the combinatory facility enables automation of genetics-led and network-based integrative prioritisation for genetic targets: (iv) at the gene level (cTGene); and (v) at the crosstalk level (cTCrosstalk). Also included is the tutorial-like booklet (in an HTML format) describing step-by-step instructions on how to use. Section 6 Development The PiER was developed using a next-generation Perl web framework Mojolicious that requires nearly zero-effort maintenance for interface updates. The PiER was also built using Bootstrap that supports the mobile-first and responsive webserver. The source codes are made available at GitHub. FIGURE 6.1: The screenshots for the PiER visited using Google Chrome in iPhone. Left: the frontpage; Right: the eV2CG interface. Section 7 eV2CG 7.1 Interface Input Step 1: a list of user-input SNPs, with 1st column for dbSNP rsIDs and 2nd column for significance info (p-values between 0 and 1). The error message will be displayed if the input is invalid. Example input data are shared genetic variants identified from cross-disease genome-wide association studies in inflammatory disorders; see Nature Genetics 2016. Mechanism Step 2: includes SNPs in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD). By default, input SNPs with a typical threshold (p-value &lt; 5e−8) are considered, and additional SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (R2 &lt; 0.8) can be also included according to the European population. Step 3: uses genomic proximity, quantitative trait locus (QTL), or promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) to identify core genes. More Controls: fine-tunes parameters involved in steps described above. Output Example Output includes two interactive tables for core genes and evidence used, and a manhattan plot (illustrating scored core genes color-coded by chromosomes). A summary of input data and the runtime (computed on the server side) is also returned to the users for the reference. FIGURE 7.1: The interface of eV2CG, linking disease associated variants (particularly located at the non-coding genomic region) to (core) genes likely responsible for associations, based on either conformation evidence (that is, promoter-centered chromatin interactions), quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (that is, genetic regulation of gene expression or protein abundance), or simply genomic proximity.

Mechanism Step 2: networks core genes with each other and with additional (peripheral) genes based on the knowledge of protein interactions, generating a ranked list of core and peripheral genes. It is achieved using the random walk with restart (RWW) algorithm. By default, the restarting probability of 0.7 is set, empirically optimised for immune-mediated diseases; selecting a value smaller than 0.6 is not recommended as there is a higher chance to expect low performance.
